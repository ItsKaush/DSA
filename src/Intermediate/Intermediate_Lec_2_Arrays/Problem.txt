Q1. Problem Description
    Given an integer array A of size N and an integer B, you have to print the same array after rotating it B times towards the right.

    Problem Constraints
    1 <= N <= 10^6
    1 <= A[i] <=10^8
    1 <= B <= 10^9

Q2. Problem Description
    You are given an array of integers A of size N.
    Return the difference between the maximum among all even numbers of A and the minimum among all odd numbers in A.

    Problem Constraints
    2 <= N <= 1e5
    -1e9 <= A[i] <= 1e9
    There is at least 1 odd and 1 even number in A

***Q3. Problem Description
    Given an array of integers A and multiple values in B, which represents the number of times array A needs to be left rotated.
    Find the rotated array for each value and return the result in the from of a matrix where ith row represents the rotated array for the ith value in B.

    Problem Constraints
    1 <= length of both arrays <= 2000
    -10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9
    0 <= B[i] <= 2000

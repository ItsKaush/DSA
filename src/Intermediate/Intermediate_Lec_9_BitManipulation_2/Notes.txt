Check ith bit is set:  n>>i & 1 == 1
                       n & (i<i) != 0


To set ith bit in a n -- n | (1<<i)
To unset ith bit in a n -- n & ~(1<<i)

To toggle ith bit in a n -- n ^ (1<<i)

Unsigned and signed integers:
    --> In signed integers, both -ve and +ve numbers are stored in the binary form. MSB contribution is always taken as -ve
    --> In unsigned integers, the MSB is used to store the +ve numbers only.

Q1. Given a string A consisting only of '(' and ')'.
    You need to find whether parentheses in A are balanced or not, if it is balanced then return 1 else return 0.

    Problem Constraints
    1 <= |A| <= 10^5

    eg: A = "(()())"
    Idea; whenever find a opening parenthesis then add it in stack,
    if finds a closing parenthesis then remove the top element which is open parenthesis

    At end if stack is empty then return 1 else return 0

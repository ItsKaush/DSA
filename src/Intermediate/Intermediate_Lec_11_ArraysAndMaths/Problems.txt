Q1. Given an array of size N, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than floor(n/2) times.
    You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exists in the array.

    Problem Constraints
    1 <= N <= 5*105
    1 <= num[i] <= 109

Brute fore TC will be max O(nlogn)
Will use Moore's Voting Algorithm: if encountered same element then increase freq else decrease freq if freq becomes 0 then change the element

Q2. You're given a read-only array of N integers. Find out if any integer occurs more than N/3 times in the array in linear time and constant additional space.
    If so, return the integer. If not, return -1.
    If there are multiple solutions, return any one.
    Note: Read-only array means that the input array should not be modified in the process of solving the problem

    Problem Constraints
    1 <= N <= 7*10^5
    1 <= A[i] <= 10^9

    eg: A: [1, 2, 3, 1, 1] candidate1 = -1, count1 = 0 candidate2 = -1, count2 = 0
            i                            i           1
               i                                                     2           1
                  i                                  0                           0
                     i                   1           2
                        i                            3

            Idea: iterate over array if canidate1 is -1 then make it current element and increase count1 else if candidate2 is -1 then
            make it current element and increase count2 else if current element is equal to candidate1 then increase count1 else if current
            element is equal to candidate2 then increase count2 else decrease count1 and count2 by 1
            if count1 is 0 then make candidate1 as current element and increase count1 else if count2 is 0 then make candidate2 as current element
            and increase count2

           Iterate over array, find candidate1 and candidate2 counts and check if it occurs more than n/3 times

            Output: 1 as 1 occurs 3 times which is more than 5/3 times.

            eg: A: [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
            output: -1 as no element occurs more than 5/3 times.

    Q3. There are 100 doors, all closed. In a nearby cage are 100 monkeys.

        The first monkey is let out and runs along the doors opening every one. The second monkey is then let out and runs along the
        doors closing the 2nd, 4th, 6th,… - all the even-numbered doors. The third monkey is let out. He attends only to the 3rd, 6th,
        9th,… doors (every third door, in other words), closing any that is open and opening any that is closed, and so on. After all
        100 monkeys have done their work in this way, what state are the doors in after the last pass?
        Answer with the number of open doors.

        eg. number of monkeys are 2     C C
        1st monkey will open all doors  O O
        2nd monkey will close all even  O C
        No of open doors are: 1

        If any door has been touched by even no of times means it will be closed, if touched by odd no of times means it will be open

        Idea: seems only the perfect squares will be open as they will be touched by odd no of times (or will have odd no of factors)
        like 1, no of factors: 1
             4  no of factore : 1, 2, 4
                               : 3
                9  no of factors: 1, 3, 9
                               : 3
                16 no of factors: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
                                 : 5
                25 no of factors: 1, 5, 25
                                    : 3

        Ans: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100

    Q4. One hundred people are standing in a circle in an order 1 to 100.

        No.1 has a sword. He kills the next person (i.e., no. 2) and gives the sword to the next (i.e., no. 3). All person does the same
        until only one survives.

        Observation. if knife is with 1 and no of people are power of 2 then the winner will be 1.
        power of 2 less than 100 is 64.
        means 36 people needs to be killed, so 36 passes will also be there
        so the current knife will be with 36 + 36 + 1= 73 and he will be alive

    Q5. Given an integer A, find and return the Ath magic number.
        A magic number is defined as a number that can be expressed as a power of 5 or a sum of unique powers of 5.
        First few magic numbers are 5, 25, 30(5 + 25), 125, 130(125 + 5), ….
            1   2   3       4       5      6      7     8      9          10           11             12           13            14
        eg: 5   25  30      125    130     150    155   625   630(625+5) 650(625+25) 655(625+25+5) 750(625+125) 755(625+5+125) 775(625+25+125) 780(625+5+25+125) 5^4
                  1st+2nd         4th+1st  4+2    4+3          *+1        8+2          8+3            8+4           *+5            8+6
        Observation: 1 perfect square
                     2nd perfect square
                     4th perfect square
                     8th perfect square
                     16th perfect square
        Given N, find power of 2 less than that number.
        eg: N = 10
           N = 2^3 + 2^1
             = 5^4 + 5^2
             = 625 + 25
             = 650

           N = 11
           N = 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0
             = 5^4 + 5^2 + 5^1
             = 625 + 25 + 5
             = 655

           N = 12
           N = 2^3 + 2^2
             = 5^4 + 5^3
             = 625 + 125
             = 750

           N = 13
           N = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0
             = 5^4 + 5^3 + 5^1
             = 625 + 125 + 5
             = 755

           Idea: keep finding power of 2 less than N and keep subtracting it from N and keep adding power of 5 in ans

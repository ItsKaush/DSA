Q1. You have given a string A having Uppercase English letters.
    You have to find how many times subsequence "AG" is there in the given string.
    NOTE: Return the answer modulo 109 + 7 as the answer can be very large.

    Problem Constraints
    1 <= length(A) <= 10^5

    e.g. A=  A B C G A G
         Brute Force:-> iterate over string whenever found A iterate on right and find count of G. TC: N^2

         A=  A B C G A G
          G: 2 2 2 2 1 1
         Ans 3 1 1 1 1 0

             Iterate from right keep record of G whenever find A add count of G in ans.

Q2. Given an array A, find the size of the smallest subarray such that it contains at least one occurrence of the maximum value of the array
    and at least one occurrence of the minimum value of the array.

    Problem Constraints
    1 <= |A| <= 2000


   Brute Force: find max and min of the array, then iterate over array and get their indexes and find the length.
   ie. A: [2,6,1,6,9,1]  max = 9 min = 1
                     i               min_index:5  max_index:4 ans = max_index-min_index + 1 = 2

Q3. A wire connects N light bulbs.
    Each bulb has a switch associated with it; however, due to faulty wiring, a switch also changes the state of all the bulbs to the right of the current bulb.
    Given an initial state of all bulbs, find the minimum number of switches you have to press to turn on all the bulbs.
    You can press the same switch multiple times.
    Note: 0 represents the bulb is off and 1 represents the bulb is on.

    ie. A: [0,1,0,1] state = 0 ans = 0
            i        state = 1 ans = 1  1 0 1 0
              i      state = 0 ans = 2  1 1 0 1
                i    state = 1 ans = 3  1 1 1 0
                  i  state = 0 ans = 4  1 1 1 1

       A: [0,0,0,1,1,1,0] state = 0 ans  = 0  0 0 0 1 1 1 0
           i              state = 1 ans = 1   1 1 1 0 0 0 1
             i            state = 1 ans = 1   1 1 1 1 1 1 0
               i          state = 1 ans = 1   1 1 1 1 1 1 1
                 i        state = 0 ans = 2

    Observation here is, when the switched has been pressed even no of times then state of right most bulbs are same as original and if the switched has been pressed
    for odd numbers of times then state of right bulbs has been toggled.

    so if count is even keep the state same as current bulb if count is odd toggle the state of current bulb and keep increasing the count if state of 0.

Q4. Given an integer array A containing N distinct integers, you have to find all the leaders in array A. An element is a leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements to
    its right side.
    NOTE: The rightmost element is always a leader.

    eg. A: [16,17,4,5,2]
             3  3 2 2 1

    idea: iterate from right and keep record of max and keep increasing ans whenever find max
